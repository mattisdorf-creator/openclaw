# pearl_fallback.bt — try multiple pearl acquisition strategies
# 1) Active enderman hunt (open areas/night)
find enderman
explore 128
sleep 10
# 2) If none found, search for villages with trades (manual interaction required)
# 3) As last resort, expand search radius and prioritize night in open biomes
explore 512
sleep 30
# 4) If still none, fallback to manual player assistance / seed change
# NOTE: trading and villager manipulation is not handled by Baritone in vanilla setups.

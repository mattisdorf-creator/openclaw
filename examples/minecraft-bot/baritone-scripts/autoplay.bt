# Minimal example script for Baritone — PoC
# This script is a starting point. Edit to improve / extend the playthrough.

# 1) Early game: gather wood
mine oak_log
mine oak_log
mine oak_log

# 2) Get some stone
mine stone
mine stone

# 3) Look for surface coal / cave (Baritone will pathfind)
# (Baritone will try to find and mine nearby coal/iron as available)
# If you want to run a longer sequence, expand this file with more commands.
